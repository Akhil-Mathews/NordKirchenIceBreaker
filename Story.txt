Story: 
1. There once was a Brot factory in a small village. 
2. I was driving my BMW to the small village.
3. When I drive my car I always rock my Laderhose!
4. Suddenly, while I was driving I came across a Hund. 
5. I also saw a baekerei and decided to get some pastries.
6. My favorite thing to buy at the baekerei is Apfelkuchen.
